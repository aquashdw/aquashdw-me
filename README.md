# aquashdw-me
Source code of main.aquashdw.me

## Frameworks
* flask
* flutter hummingbird

## Why flask?
Easiest and most familiar for the developer(me).

## Why hummingbird?
Because he doesn't like html, js, or css. ;)

## Review
* Hummingbird is still in it's early stage
* DecorationImage colorFilter doesn't work for hummingbird (works fine for chrome), so I had to make a new background image with opencv
* Https problems (had to type in the domain https://main.aquashdw.me directly, check app.py), could not find the solution (ssl handled with nginx)
